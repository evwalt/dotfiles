# Dotfiles

## Overview

This repository leverages [yadm](https://yadm.io) to manage dotfiles, settings, and text files in my macOS home directory. `yadm` simplifies tracking and synchronizing these files across systems. The local `yadm` repository is stored at `.local/share/yadm/repo.git`.

## Regular Maintenance

To update and track dependencies, sync lazy.nvim plugins and then run `dua` regularly, ideally every week. See [aliases](./.aliases) for details.
